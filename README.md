# Arxiv Project
This repository contains the sectioned (earliest) version of my project interacting with arxiv.org.

This version contains two jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files: 

one web scraping/pulling pdfs from 2017-2019 in the economics section of arxiv.org (PullPDFs.ipynb),

the other finding names, the title, and details all in the acknowledgements section                                            showcasing contributors to try and bring what they've done to light (SeparateAndAnalyzePDFs.ipynb).
